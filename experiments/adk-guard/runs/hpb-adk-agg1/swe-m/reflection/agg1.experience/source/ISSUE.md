# #142 Invoice totals wrong for discounted EU invoices

Reported by finance:

- `compute_totals([LineItem("widget", 3, "19.99", 10)], "eu")` raises KeyError.
- With "EU" the tax is charged on the undiscounted amount.
- Totals are sometimes a cent off (float rounding), e.g. a 0.125 unit price.

Please make `invoicing.totals.compute_totals` follow docs/ROUNDING.md.
