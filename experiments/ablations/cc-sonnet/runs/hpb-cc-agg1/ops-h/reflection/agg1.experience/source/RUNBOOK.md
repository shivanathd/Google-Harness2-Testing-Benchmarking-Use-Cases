# Gateway fleet runbook (excerpt)

- Access logs are JSON lines in logs/<service>.jsonl (billing's is gzip-compressed).
- The log shipper occasionally truncates a line; skip lines that are not valid JSON.
- `/healthz` is the load balancer's probe. Exclude it from every traffic statistic.
- Errors are responses with status >= 500. 4xx responses are client errors, not errors.
- Schema change: since 2026-10-04 09:00 UTC billing logs `latency_s` (seconds, float)
  instead of `latency_ms`. Other services always log `latency_ms`.
