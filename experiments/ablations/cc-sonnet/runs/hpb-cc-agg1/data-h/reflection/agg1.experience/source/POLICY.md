# Revenue recognition policy (finance ops)

1. Revenue is recognised when a charge is `captured`. Use the `captured_at` timestamp
   converted to UTC to decide the month. `authorized` and `voided` charges are not revenue.
2. `amount_minor` is in the currency's minor unit: cents for USD and EUR, paise for INR.
   JPY has no minor unit, so its `amount_minor` is whole yen.
3. Convert to USD with fx.csv (one rate per currency for the month).
4. Charges from customers flagged `is_test = true` in customers.csv are excluded everywhere,
   including chargebacks.
5. A chargeback (chargebacks.csv) reverses the full original charge and costs a 15.00 USD
   fee. Both are booked in the month of `chargeback_at` (UTC), whenever the charge was made.
6. Round only the final figure to cents.
